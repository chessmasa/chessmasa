## Timeline

A brief history of our project followed by our future aspirations.

### Origins

Where it all began...

### Ultimate Goal

We would like to make our bot faster and more powerful by utilizing artificial intelligence. There are some interesting APIs such as [OpenChess](#https://api.openchess.io/index.html) that easily give us access to a bot, but it would be neat to look into creating out own as well.
