## Timeline

A brief history of our project followed by our future aspirations.

### Origins

smonterola first created this project over the summer of 2024.

### Ultimate Goal

We would like to make our bot faster and more powerful by utilizing artificial intelligence. There are some interesting APIs such as [OpenChess](https://api.openchess.io/index.html) that easily give us access to a bot, but it would be neat to look into creating out own as well.

## Documentation

### Installation

You can clone this repository and then run `npm install` and `npm start` to develop locally

### Usage

You can click on a piece to see its valid moves. You will only be able to see the valid moves for the color whose turn it is. Then you can drag and drop the pieces to the desired square when you are ready. The buttons at the top of the screen include an option to reset the board, have the bot choose the next move, a selection for which piece to promote to (queen/rook/bishop/knight), and documentation (which brings you to this page).
